# Star Wars Wiki

![Star Wars Wiki](https://github.com/sarahdewitt/star-wars-wiki/raw/main/public/images/readme-cover.png "Star Wars Wiki Cover")

A simple star wars wiki website fully coded in **Next.js** and **SWAPI**, styled with **TailwindCSS** and animated transitions handled by **Framer Motion**.

Designed and developed with ❤️ by [Sarah De Witt](https://sarahdewitt.github.io).

_Heads up! This is my first rodeo using Next.js 14 with TypeScript for external API data fetching. Hold on tight, it’s a bumpy ride! Criticism and feedback are encouraged._

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo here: [https://star-wars-wiki-pi.vercel.app]

## Usage

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
